Palazzi books you a moment in which you go into his office and then you do your presentation - it won't make you present every single slide, he will make you questions, particularly on figures, to understand you actually read and elaborated all of the papers, but for the most of the time, he will let you talk.

Make him understand you studies and he can even higher your mark from the oral exam (in case you did it separately)

In my case, my project was considered pretty good and I increased my oral mark by 2 points (from 25 of the oral exam to 27)

After you do your exam, he will register the vote on the booklet in front of you, so you will have it immediately.
